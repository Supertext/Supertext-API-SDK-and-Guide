# Supertext SDK for .NET

Client for the Supertext AI translation API: translate HTML and texts, with the supported languages, rate-limit retries and HTML packing handled for you. NuGet package `Supertext.Sdk`, `net8.0`, no dependencies.

Everything that talks to the API v1 is in the namespace **`Supertext.Sdk.V1`**. A later API version gets `Supertext.Sdk.V2` next to it, so an integration can move at its own pace. Only the SDK's version, `Supertext.Sdk.SdkInfo.Version`, is outside the versioned namespace.

It packages what Supertext's CMS plugins learned against the live API (October 2026). Background and the protocol: [integration guide](../../docs/integration-guide.md).

## Install

```sh
dotnet add package Supertext.Sdk
```

You need an API key. No Supertext account yet? Create one at https://www.supertext.com/person/en/account/signin. Generate your API key at https://www.supertext.com/en/integrations/api (supertext.com → Integrations → API; requires the Admin role). Paste the key with or without its `Supertext-Auth-Key` prefix.

## Quick start

```csharp
using Supertext.Sdk.V1;

var client = new SupertextClient(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SUPERTEXT_API_KEY"),
    new SupertextClientOptions { UserAgent = "My-CMS-Plugin/1.0.0" });

// Keyed texts: packed into one HTML document, translated, unpacked. Results come back in input order.
var translated = await client.TranslateTextsAsync(new Dictionary<string, Segment>
{
    ["title"] = "Hello & welcome",                                        // plain text (escaped, \n → <br>)
    ["body"] = new Segment("<p>Our <b>new</b> shop opens on Monday.</p>", Html: true),
}, targetLang: "de-CH", sourceLang: "en", politeness: Politeness.More);

Console.WriteLine(translated["title"]);

// A whole HTML document: upload, poll, download, delete.
string html = await client.TranslateHtmlAsync("<p>Hello</p>", "fr-CH");
```

Send each paragraph (heading, list item) as **one** segment, with formatting and links as inline tags. Every segment is translated on its own; splitting a sentence at its formatting breaks the translation.

`TranslateTextsAsync` takes any `IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, Segment>>`. Blank texts come back unchanged and cost no request. Large inputs are split into several documents of at most `maxCharacters` (default 900,000), sent one after the other.

The language codes are sent exactly as given (only trimmed): pass Supertext codes, resolved with `Languages` (below). An empty target throws `unsupported_language` without a request; a null or empty source is left out (Supertext detects the language).

The lower-level steps are public too: `GetFeaturesAsync` (the live language pairs, see below), `SubmitAsync`, `GetStatusAsync`, `WaitUntilDoneAsync`, `DownloadAsync`, `DeleteAsync` (never throws), `ValidateApiKeyAsync` (a cost-free key check that throws) and `CheckApiKeyAsync` (the same check as a result, see below). Every method takes a `CancellationToken`.

## Languages

`Languages.Sources` and `Languages.Targets` list what Supertext offers (`SourceLanguage(Code, Name)`, `TargetLanguage(Code, Name, Politeness)`). Sources are bare languages (`en`, `de`, `gsw`). Targets are exactly what Supertext expects: with a region for German, English, French, Italian and Portuguese (`de-CH`, `en-US`, `pt-BR`), with a script for Chinese and Serbian (`zh-Hans`, `sr-Latn`), a dialect for Swiss German (`gsw-u-sd-chzh`), bare for the others (`es`, `nl`, `sl`). Anything else is rejected by the API (`invalid_language_pair`).

There is **no default region and no guessing**: `de` is not a target, because the SDK can't know whether your site means Germany, Austria or Switzerland. Let the administrator map each CMS language (a setting per language) and resolve it before you call the client:

```csharp
// The integration's language setting: CMS language → Supertext code.
var mapping = new Dictionary<string, string> { ["de"] = "de-CH", ["no"] = "nb" };

var target = Languages.Target(cmsLanguage, mapping);  // "de" → "de-CH", "fr_ch" → "fr-CH" (exact match), "it" → unsupported_language
var source = Languages.Source(cmsSource, mapping);    // "en-US" → "en", "" → "" (auto-detect)
await client.TranslateTextsAsync(texts, target, source);

Languages.MatchTarget("de_ch");          // "de-CH" (case and _/- don't matter); "de" → null
Languages.MatchSource("en-GB");          // "en" (exact, else the first subtag)
Languages.SupportsPoliteness("en-US");   // false (true for de-CH; null for a code not in the list)
Languages.IsSupportedTarget("es-ES");    // false
Languages.IsSupportedSource("gsw");      // true
```

`Target` returns the mapping's value (trimmed, sent even if it isn't in the list, so a language Supertext adds later works before the SDK knows it), else an exact match, else throws `SupertextException` with code `unsupported_language` and `TargetLang` set; nothing is sent. `Source` works the same way (`SourceLang` set), and an empty source stays empty. Mapping keys are compared like codes (case, `_`/`-` and spaces don't matter); blank values are ignored. Use `MatchTarget` to prefill the mapping for CMS languages that already are Supertext codes.

**The live list.** `GetFeaturesAsync()` returns the language pairs the API offers right now (`GET features`, no cost) as `FeatureSupport(SourceLang, TargetLang, Features)`, with features such as `supports_politeness`, e.g. for a settings page. Malformed entries are skipped.

## Politeness

`Politeness.Default` (nothing is sent), `Politeness.More` (formal: Sie, vous, Lei) or `Politeness.Less` (informal: du, tu). Not every target offers it (`TargetLanguage.Politeness`, `Languages.SupportsPoliteness`): for `en-US`, `rm`, `sq` and others the API answers `unsupported_feature`. Hide the formal/informal choice for those targets; the SDK sends what it is given.

## Errors

Everything the API or the client can't handle is a `SupertextException` with `Code` (constants in `SupertextErrorCodes`), an English `Message`, and `Status`, `Detail`, `ApiErrorCode`, `SourceLang`/`TargetLang` and `Feature` where known. The API key never appears in messages or details. Cancelling your token throws `OperationCanceledException` as usual.

| Code | Meaning | What to tell the user |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `missing_api_key` | No key configured; nothing was sent | Enter the API key in the settings (with the account and API-key links above) |
| `authentication_failure` | HTTP 401/403 | The API key is wrong or revoked: check it (links above) |
| `invalid_language_pair` | HTTP 400 (404 for an unknown language) `INVALID_LANGUAGE_PAIR` | Supertext doesn't support this language combination; check the language mapping |
| `unsupported_language` | No request was sent: the language has no Supertext code (no mapping, no exact match) or the target is empty | Map this language to a Supertext language in the settings |
| `unsupported_feature` | HTTP 400 `FEATURE_ERROR`: the pair exists, but not with this option (`Feature`, e.g. `politeness`) | Formal/informal isn't available for this language; choose the default |
| `not_found` | HTTP 404 | The file expired or was deleted; try again |
| `payload_too_large` | HTTP 413 | The content is too large; translate less at once |
| `too_many_requests` | HTTP 429 after all retries | Too many requests; try again in a moment |
| `service_unavailable` | HTTP 5xx | Supertext is unavailable; try again later |
| `unexpected_status` | Any other HTTP status | Unexpected answer from Supertext (show `Status`/`Detail`) |
| `transport_error` | No answer (DNS, TLS, refused, request timeout) | Supertext can't be reached; check the server's network |
| `no_file_id` | Upload answered without a file id | Unexpected answer from Supertext; try again |
| `translation_error` | File status `error` | Supertext couldn't translate this content |
| `quota_exceeded` | File status `limit_exceeded` | The account's translation limit is used up |
| `file_deleted` | File status `deleted` | The file was deleted before download; try again |
| `timeout` | Not done within `Timeout` | The translation is taking too long; try again or translate less at once |
| `incomplete_response` | Empty download or missing texts (`Detail`: `missing: key1, key2`) | The translation came back incomplete; try again |

## API key check

`CheckApiKeyAsync()` calls `GET features` (no cost, at most `ApiKeyCheck.Timeout` = 10 s, the usual 429 retries) and never throws (test vectors: `spec/api-key-check.json`). It returns an `ApiKeyCheck` (`Status`: `ok`, `invalid` (401/403), `missing` (blank key, nothing sent), `unreachable` (no answer or 5xx), `error`; plus `CheckedAt`, `HttpStatus`, `ErrorCode` and `Fingerprint`, a SHA-256 of the key from `ApiKeyCheck.FingerprintOf(key)` to notice a changed one; the key itself is never kept). Show it on your settings page. If it says `invalid` or `missing`: no Supertext account yet? Create one at https://www.supertext.com/person/en/account/signin. Generate your API key at https://www.supertext.com/en/integrations/api (supertext.com → Integrations → API; requires the Admin role).

Version reports to the Supertext Commando Center and its ping endpoint are [Supertext Plugin Health](https://github.com/Supertext/Commando-Center-Supertext-Translation/tree/main/plugin-health), not this SDK. Pass it `CheckApiKeyAsync()` and `ApiKeyCheck.FingerprintOf` as the key checker and `SdkInfo.Version` as the SDK version.

## Options

`SupertextClientOptions` (all optional):

| Option | Default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BaseUrl` | `https://api.supertext.com/v1/` | A trailing slash is added if missing |
| `PollInterval` | 2 s | Wait between status polls |
| `Timeout` | 180 s | Give up waiting for a file |
| `RequestTimeout` | 30 s | Per HTTP request, including reading the answer |
| `MaxRetries` | 4 | Retries after HTTP 429 (`Retry-After` in seconds, else 1/2/4/8/16 s … with jitter; max. 30 s) |
| `UserAgent` | none | Appended to `supertext-sdk-dotnet`, e.g. `My-CMS-Plugin/1.0.0` |
| `HttpClient` | shared internal client | E.g. from `IHttpClientFactory`; its `Timeout` should be ≥ `RequestTimeout` |
| `Sleep` | `Task.Delay` | Replace in tests |
| `TimeProvider` | `TimeProvider.System` | Clock for the polling timeout and the key check's `CheckedAt`; replace in tests |

Also public: `SupertextClient.AuthHeader(key)`, `SupertextClient.RetryDelayMs(attempt, retryAfter)`, `HtmlDocument.Build` / `Parse` if you build documents yourself.

## Testing against the stand-in

The repository's stand-in API (`stand-in/stand-in.mjs`, Node 18+) behaves like the live API where integrations went wrong before, and prefixes each translated segment with the target code (`[de-CH]`):

```sh
node stand-in/stand-in.mjs          # http://127.0.0.1:8765/v1/
```

Point `BaseUrl` at it. For unit tests, pass an `HttpClient` with your own `HttpMessageHandler`, plus `Sleep` and `TimeProvider` fakes (see `tests/`).

## Development

From the repository root:

```sh
dotnet build sdk/dotnet -warnaserror
dotnet test sdk/dotnet                       # unit tests + spec/*.json vectors
dotnet build sdk/dotnet/examples/Conformance -c Release
node stand-in/conformance.mjs -- dotnet sdk/dotnet/examples/Conformance/bin/Release/net8.0/Conformance.dll
dotnet pack sdk/dotnet/src/Supertext.Sdk -c Release -o sdk/dotnet/artifacts
```
