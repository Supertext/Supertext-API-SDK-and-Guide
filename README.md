# Supertext API: integration guide and SDKs

Everything you need to connect a CMS, shop, PIM or your own software to Supertext's AI translation API: a guide built from more than 30 Supertext plugins, and SDKs for five languages that handle the tricky parts for you.

- **[Integration guide](docs/integration-guide.md)**: the protocol, language codes, how to cut content into segments, rich text, rate limits, errors, writing translations back, security, testing, and a checklist.
- **[API reference](docs/api-reference.md)**: endpoints, fields, statuses and HTTP errors on one page.
- **SDKs**: below.
- **[Test vectors](spec/)** and a **[stand-in API](stand-in/stand-in.mjs)** for your own tests.

You need a Supertext API key. No Supertext account yet? Create one at [supertext.com](https://www.supertext.com/person/en/account/signin). Generate your API key at [supertext.com → Integrations → API](https://www.supertext.com/en/integrations/api) (requires the Admin role).

## SDKs

| Language | Package | Requirements | Docs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript / JavaScript | `npm install supertext-sdk` | Node 18+, Deno, Bun; no dependencies | [sdk/typescript](sdk/typescript/README.md) |
| PHP | `composer require supertext/supertext-sdk` | PHP 8.1+; no dependencies (ext-curl only for the built-in HTTP transport) | [sdk/php](sdk/php/README.md) |
| Python | `pip install supertext-sdk` | Python 3.10+; standard library only | [sdk/python](sdk/python/README.md) |
| .NET | `dotnet add package Supertext.Sdk` | .NET 8+ | [sdk/dotnet](sdk/dotnet/README.md) |
| Java | `com.supertext:supertext-sdk` (Maven) | Java 11+; no dependencies | [sdk/java](sdk/java/README.md) |

The packages aren't on the public registries yet; until they are, install from this repository or the files attached to a [release](https://github.com/Supertext/Supertext-API-SDK-and-Guide/releases).

All five offer the same things, named the way each language expects, in a **`v1` namespace** for the API version (TypeScript `supertext-sdk/v1`, PHP `Supertext\Sdk\V1`, Python `supertext.v1`, .NET `Supertext.Sdk.V1`, Java `com.supertext.sdk.v1`), so a later API version can sit next to it:

- `translateTexts(segments, target, source?, politeness?)`: many keyed texts (plain or HTML) in one go, split into documents under the size limit, translated one after the other, read back by key.
- `translateHtml(html, target, source?, politeness?)`: one HTML document, the full round trip.
- The single steps (`submit`, `getStatus`, `waitUntilDone`, `download`, `delete`), `validateApiKey` (a cost-free key check for settings pages) and `getFeatures` (the language pairs the API offers right now).
- The Commando Center building blocks every Supertext plugin uses: `checkApiKey` (the automatic key check with its result), `InstallationReporter` (version reports) and `pingResponse` (the public ping endpoint). See the [guide](docs/integration-guide.md#14-version-reports-the-api-key-check-and-the-ping-endpoint).
- `Languages`: the API's source and target languages, an exact match for CMS codes (`de_CH` → `de-CH`), the integration's language mapping, and which targets offer formal/informal. No default regions and no guessing: an unmapped language is the error `unsupported_language`. The client sends the codes it is given.
- `HtmlDocument`: the segment packing, if you drive the steps yourself.
- One error type with stable codes (`authentication_failure`, `invalid_language_pair`, `quota_exceeded`, …) to show users a message in their language.
- Built in: the `Supertext-Auth-Key` header (pasted prefixes stripped), the exact multipart upload the API accepts, HTTP 429 retries with `Retry-After`, polling with a timeout, and deleting the file afterwards, also after errors.

Quick look (TypeScript; the others are in their READMEs):

```ts
import { Languages, SupertextClient } from 'supertext-sdk/v1'

const client = new SupertextClient(process.env.SUPERTEXT_API_KEY ?? '')
const mapping = { de: 'de-CH' } // the plugin's language setting: CMS language → Supertext code
const german = await client.translateTexts(
  { title: 'Hello & welcome', body: { text: '<p>Our <b>new</b> shop opens on Monday.</p>', html: true } },
  Languages.target('de', mapping), // 'de-CH'; an unmapped 'de' would throw unsupported_language
  { sourceLang: Languages.source('en-US'), politeness: 'more' },
)
```

## Testing your integration

```sh
node stand-in/stand-in.mjs     # Supertext stand-in on http://127.0.0.1:8765/v1/
```

It enforces the rules the live API enforces (auth header, language codes, the file's Content-Type, size limit) and "translates" by putting `[de-CH] ` in front of each segment. See [Testing](docs/integration-guide.md#13-testing).
